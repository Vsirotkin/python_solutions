# Excel Multiplication Table Generator

## Overview

This Python script generates an Excel file containing a multiplication table based on user input. The script uses the `openpyxl` library to create and manipulate the Excel file. The multiplication table is generated efficiently by minimizing the number of accesses to the Excel sheet and leveraging in-memory operations for the multiplication calculations.

## Features

- **User Input**: Prompts the user to enter a number, which determines the size of the multiplication table.
- **Efficient Generation**: Utilizes lists to store header values, reducing the number of accesses to the Excel sheet and speeding up the multiplication process.
- **Elapsed Time Measurement**: Measures and displays the time taken to generate the Excel file.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `openpyxl` library

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/excel-multiplication-table.git
   cd excel-multiplication-table
   ```

2. **Install the required library**:
   ```sh
   pip install openpyxl
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the script**:
   ```sh
   python generate_multiplication_table.py
   ```

2. **Enter the desired number** when prompted. The script will generate an Excel file named `my_multiplication.xlsx` containing the multiplication table.

## Performance

The script has been optimized for performance by:
- Storing header values in lists to minimize accesses to the Excel sheet.
- Performing multiplication calculations using in-memory operations.

## Future Improvements

- **Parallel Processing**: Implement parallel processing for very large multiplication tables to further improve performance.
- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for user input to manage non-integer or negative values gracefully.
- **Memory Optimization**: Monitor memory usage for very large values of `num` and consider more memory-efficient data structures if necessary.
